/**

 * @{
 * @brief Definitions and prototypes for the THS interface.
 *
 * @details The Throughput Service is a customized GATT-based service with Settings, Toggle,
 *          Tx and Rx characteristics. The developer uses the service to test throughput. 
 *          The data is sent to the peer as Handle Value Notification, and the data received
 *          from the peer is transmitted with GATT Write Command.
 *
 *          The peer writes Toggle characteristic to command the application starting/stopping
 *          throughput. The application calls \ref ths_data_send() to send data to the peer. 
 *          The application handles \ref THS_EVT_DATA_RECEIVED in \ref ths_init_t.evt_handler()
 *          to get the data received from the peer. The application uses ths_settings_notify() to
 *          request the change of the parameters related with throughput, including CI, MTU, PDU and PHY.
